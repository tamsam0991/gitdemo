Python Data Types
There are different types of python data types. Some built-in python data types are:


1)Python Data Type – Numeric
        Python numeric data type is used to hold numeric values like;
int – holds signed integers of non-limited length. 
float- holds floating precision numbers and it’s accurate upto 15 decimal places.
complex- holds complex numbers.

In Python we need not to declare datatype while declaring a variable like C or C++. We can simply just assign values in a variable. But if we want to see what type of numerical value is it holding right now, we can use type(), like this:

#create a variable with integer value.
a=100
print("The type of variable having value", a, " is ", type(a))

#create a variable with float value.
b=10.2345
print("The type of variable having value", b, " is ", type(b))

#create a variable with complex value.
c=100+3j
print("The type of variable having value", c, " is ", type(c))
If you run the above code you will see output like the below image.
 
2)Python Data Type – String
The string is a sequence of characters. Python supports Unicode characters. Generally, strings are represented by either single or double quotes.

a = "string in a double quote"
b= 'string in a single quote'
print(a)
print(b)

# using ',' to concatenate the two or several strings
print(a,"concatenated with",b)

#using '+' to concate the two or several strings
print(a+" concated with "+b)
The above code produce output like below picture-

Python Data Type – List
The list is a versatile data type exclusive in Python. In a sense, it is the same as the array in C/C++. But the interesting thing about the list in Python is it can simultaneously hold different types of data. Formally list is an ordered sequence of some data written using square brackets([]) and commas(,).

#list of having only integers
a= [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(a)

#list of having only strings
b=["hello","john","reese"]
print(b)

#list of having both integers and strings
c= ["hey","you",1,2,3,"go"]
print(c)

#index are 0 based. this will print a single character
print(c[1]) #this will print "you" in list c
The above code will produce output like this-
 
5)Python Data Type – Tuple
Tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to list. But it is immutable. That means data in a tuple is write protected. Data in a tuple is written using parenthesis and commas.

#tuple having only integer type of data.
a=(1,2,3,4)
print(a) #prints the whole tuple

#tuple having multiple type of data.
b=("hello", 1,2,3,"go")
print(b) #prints the whole tuple

#index of tuples are also 0 based.

print(b[4]) #this prints a single element in a tuple, in this case "go"
The output of this above python data type tuple example code will be like below image.

Dictionary
Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form. It is similar to the hash table type. Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form key:value. It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.

#a sample dictionary variable

a = {1:"first name",2:"last name", "age":33}

#print value having key=1
print(a[1])
#print value having key=2
print(a[2])
#print value having key="age"
print(a["age"])
If you run this python dictionary data type example code, output will be like below image.
 
So that’s all for today about python data types. Don’t forget to run every piece of code in your own machine. Also don’t just copy-paste. Try to write the lines of code on your own.
